# TCP Server-Client implementation in C
TCP Server – 

using create(), Create TCP socket.
using bind(), Bind the socket to server address.
using listen(), put the server socket in a passive mode, where it waits for the client to approach the server to make a connection
using accept(), At this point, connection is established between client and server, and they are ready to transfer data.
Go back to Step 3.
TCP Client – 

Create TCP socket.
connect newly created client socket to server.
